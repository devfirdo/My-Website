				<h4>My Journey into the World of Coding and Creativity</h4>
				<hr>
					<p>From my earliest encounters with computers, I knew I had found my true calling. Graduating with a BSc in Computer Science, I embarked on a thrilling journey through the realms of coding and creativity. </p>

					<p>Much like a painter with a canvas, I approach coding as an art, blending the scientific precision of programming with the boundless possibilities of imagination.</p>

					<p>I am not just a developer; I am a perpetual learner. Collaborating with YouTube, GitHub, and various online resources, I bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. As I tread the path of a fresher seeking new opportunities, I am committed to completing projects with unwavering dedication and assistance.</p>
